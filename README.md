# Uncommon HTML Bug: Disappearing Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML and JavaScript where an element disappears after a button click and isn't easily recoverable. The core problem lies in the JavaScript function that hides the element without providing a mechanism to show it again.  This example showcases a common mistake in DOM manipulation that developers may encounter.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with a div and a button. Clicking the button hides the div. The problem is that there's no way to make it visible again without refreshing the page. This demonstrates a scenario where improper DOM manipulation could lead to unexpected behavior for a user.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version of the code. It adds functionality to toggle the visibility of the div.  By adding an appropriate mechanism to restore the visibility or re-append the element if necessary, this problem can be avoided.
